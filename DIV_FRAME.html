Similique architecto dicta reprehenderit fugit veritatis sequi velit aspernatur ipsum adipisci sed!I have always believed that a man must be honest. «Never ask for money you have not earned», I always said. Now I shall tell you a story which will show you how honest I have always been all my life. A few days ago at my friend’s house I met General Miles. General Miles was a nice man and we became great friends very quickly. «Did you live in Washington in 1867?» the general asked me. «Yes, I did,» I answered. «How could it happen that we did not meet then?» said General Miles.... For an hour I was walking along the streets of Washington and was very tired. At last I came to a big hotel. «I shall go in and have a rest,» I thought.
